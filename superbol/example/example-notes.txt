Example 1: 2015bn

- Multiple filters per file
- Input already in rest-frame absolute magnitude
- Covers UV-NIR (blackbody correction negligible if run with all filters
- Play with effects of leaving out different filters

Example 2: Gaia16apd

- One filter per file
- MJD, apparent magnitudes (only extinction correction applied)
- Some mismatch in timing of different filters
- Useful to experiment with interpolations/extrapolations
- Can run multiple times with different reference bands to stitch together light curve
- No NIR so BB correction important
